DESCMOOACCORDION=<p>MooAccordion makes it very easy to add MooTools accordion slides (show/hide blocks) to any article. The syntax is simple: {mooblock=Trigger Title (used to trigger the slide)}<br />Content of the slide block...{/mooblock}.</p><p>Features include: </p><ul><li>adds class for active block title, allowing you to toggle it's icon (for ex, from a + to a - icon)</li><li>adds minimal markup (and intelligently strips unnecessary markup added by editors like tinyMCE and JCE, if present) to keep the html clean and valid</li><li>uses Joomla core MooTools library, which means this plugin adds <i>no</i> HTTP requests, minimizes dependencies, prevents JS conflicts, and makes it very lightweight</li><li>very easy for anyone to use (without technical knowledge) and very flexible</li><li>the show/hide effects and other settings are easily customizable from the plugin's configuration</li></ul><p>Note: the title can contain html if desired. If it is wrapped by one html element, that element will be used as the title toggler. Otherwise, it will wrap the title in a &lt;p&gt; tag. Also, the title cannot contain '}' or the plugin will incorrectly interpret that as the end of the title.</p><p>Lastly, <i>don't forget to publish the plugin</i>!</p>
